void setup() {
  // Code in these brackets only runs ONCE right after you upload the
  // sketch. This is where we do things like tell Arduino how to configure
  // a pin (input or output), start serial commmunication, calibrate sensors, etc.

  // If you want something to happen over and over again, like reading a value
  // from a sensor or turning on an LED when a button is pressed, you need to
  // put it in the loop()

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  // This is where your main code lives. Code in these brackets runs over and over
  // again. It executes line by line from top to bottom, exactly as you tell it to do.
